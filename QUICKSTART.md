# üöÄ Quick Start - 5 Minutes

## Step 1: Check Python

Open PowerShell and type:

```powershell
python --version
```

If you see a version (e.g., `Python 3.11.x`), go to Step 2.

Otherwise, install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Step 2: Configuration Ready ‚úÖ

Your configuration is already customized with:
- ‚úÖ Email: abdelhadi.jbilou@gmail.com
- ‚úÖ RSS Feeds: Azure Security, Architecture, Database, App Services, Terraform, HashiCorp, GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Smart summaries enabled

You can modify `config.yaml` if needed.

## Step 3: First Test

In PowerShell, from this folder:

```powershell
.\run_tech_watch.ps1 -OpenReport
```

‚è±Ô∏è First run: ~2 minutes (dependency installation)  
‚è±Ô∏è Subsequent runs: ~30 seconds

## Step 4: Setup Email (Optional)

To receive daily email reports:

1. Generate a Gmail App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Edit `config.yaml` and fill in:
   - `smtp_username`: Your Gmail address
   - `smtp_password`: The 16-character App Password

See [GMAIL_SETUP.md](GMAIL_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## Step 5: Automate (Optional)

Launch PowerShell **as Administrator**:

```powershell
.\setup_task_scheduler.ps1
```

That's it! You'll receive a report every morning at 9 AM. üéâ
